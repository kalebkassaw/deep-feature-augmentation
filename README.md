# Deep Feature Augmentation
Adapted from Cen et al., Deep Feature Augmentation for Occluded Image Classification, 2020. (arXiv:2011.00768)

Functional on an OVIS (Qi et al., 2021, arXiv:2102.01558) crop-target dataset, though, with some work, can be adapted to function well on any MMClassification-like dataset ([see reference](https://mmclassification.readthedocs.io/en/latest/tutorials/new_dataset.html)).

More details soon.
